# KinectProject

A game that uses a kinect as controller. 
The projectIEC directory contains the whole unity project. This is what you need to download and open it with Unity. 
It was done with Unity 5.0 so try to use this version to open the project. Although the automatic update should work I wasn't able to test the build since I don't have a kinect anymore.
